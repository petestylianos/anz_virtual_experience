# Presentation Link


The presentation can be accessed from this __[link](https://anz-presentation.netlify.app)__. 
Instead of a powerpoint the presentation is hosted online in order to provide interactive components for the user.  

In the __Forage__ website I had to upload a file, otherwise I would have just provided the link.

Thank you very much.
